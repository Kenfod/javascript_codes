    <h1>Variable Scope</h1>

    <pre>
      Variable scope is the context of the program in which it can be accessed. 
      In programming, a variable is a named storage location that holds data or a value. 
      Think of it as a container that you can use to store and manipulate information in your code. 
      Variables allow you to work with data in a flexible way, as the values they hold can change during the execution of a program.

      In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords. Here's a brief overview of each:

      Variable Declaration      Description

      var                       - The oldest way to declare variables. It has function scope and is hoisted.

      let                       - Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). It has block scope and is also hoisted.

      const                     - Also introduced in ES6. It is used to declare constants and has block scope.
                                  Unlike let, a const variable cannot be reassigned.

      Now, let's delve into the concept of Variable Scope in JavaScript:

      <b>Variable Scope</b>
      Variable scope in JavaScript is the region of the code where a particular variable can be accessed or modified.

      <b>Types of Scopes in JavaScript: </b>
          1-Block scope
          2-Function scope
          3-Local scope
          4-Global scope

      <b>Block scope</b>
      Earlier JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. 
      <b>let</b> and <b>const</b> are the two new important keywords that were introduced by the 
      ES6 and these two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. 
      ECMAScript (ES6) 2015 was the second major revision to JavaScript. 
      Variables that are declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.

      Variables declared with the <b>var</b> keyword cannot have block scope and they can be declared inside a { } block and can be accessed from outside the block.

      <b>Function scope</b>
      JavaScript has function scope and each function creates a new scope. 
      Variables defined inside a function are not accessible from outside the function and variables declared with var, 
      <b>let</b> and <b></b> are quite similar when declared inside a function. 

      <b>Local scope</b>
      Variables declared inside a function become local to the function. 
      Local variables are created when a function starts and deleted when the function is executed. 
      Local variables have Function Scope which means that they can only be accessed from within the function.

      <b>Global scope</b>
      Variables declared Globally (outside of any function) have Global Scope and Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a program. 
      Similar to function scope variables declared with <b>var</b>, <b></b> and <b>const</b> are quite similar when declared outside a block.
