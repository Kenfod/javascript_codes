    <h1>Function Expression</h1>

    <pre>
       A function expression in JavaScript is a way of defining a function as part of an expression, rather than as a standalone declaration. 
       Unlike function declarations, function expressions can be anonymous (without a name) and are often assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions.

        <b>Key characteristics of function expressions:</b>
        <b>1. Anonymous or Named:</b>
        <b>a. Anonymous Function Expression:</b> 
        The most common form, where the function keyword is followed by parentheses for parameters and curly braces for the body, without a function name. 
        This function is typically assigned to a variable.

                  const greet = function(name) {
                    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
                  };

        <b>b. Named Function Expression:</b>
        Less common, but allows giving a name to the function within the expression. 
        This name is primarily useful for debugging and for recursive calls within the function itself.

                          const factorial = function calculateFactorial(n) {
                            if (n <= 1) {
                              return 1;
                            }
                            return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
                          };

        <b>2. Not Hoisted:</b>
        Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not "hoisted" to the top of their scope. 
        This means they can only be called or invoked after they have been defined in the code. 
        Attempting to call a function expression before its definition will result in an error.
        
        <b>3. Treated as Values:</b>
        In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be treated like any other value.
        Function expressions leverage this by allowing functions to be assigned to variables, 
        stored in data structures, passed as arguments to other functions (callbacks), and returned from functions.

        <b>Common use cases for function expressions:</b>
        <b>1. Callbacks:</b>
        Passing a function as an argument to another function to be executed later 
        (e.g., in setTimeout, event listeners, array methods like map, filter, reduce).

        <b>2. Closures:</b>
        Creating functions that "remember" the environment in which they were created, 
        even after that environment has ceased to exist.

        <b>3. Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs):</b>
        Creating a function expression and immediately executing it, 
        often used to create a private scope and avoid polluting the global namespace.

        <b>4. Dynamic Function Creation:</b>
        Defining functions conditionally or within loops.
