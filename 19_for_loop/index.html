    <h1>For Loop</h1>

    <pre>
        JavaScript for loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. 
        It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

        JavaScript has different kinds of loops. Some of the loops are:

            Loop	                    Description
        1. for loop	        = A loop that repeats a block of code a specific number of times based on a conditional expression.
        2. while loop	        = A loop that repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
        3. do-while loop	= A loop that executes a block of code at least once, then repeats the block as long as a specified condition is true.
        4. for...of loop	= Iterates over the values of an iterable object (like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.)
        5. for...in loop	= Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object (including inherited properties).
